# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
this project focuses on using human-computer interaction method - voice intelligence and detects emotion.
this field of study consists of three components:
1) Speech Identification
2) Speech Recognition 
3) Speech Emotion Detection
speech emotion detection is a challenging implementation due to into intense complexity because, the computer is required to mimic the human behaviour. 
This detection can be implemented with the help of multiple machine learning algorithms.
